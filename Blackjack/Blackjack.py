############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
house = []
player = []
player_busted = False
house_busted = False
player_score = house_score = 0
play_hand = 'y'
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.
